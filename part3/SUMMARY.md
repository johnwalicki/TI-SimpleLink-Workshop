# Workshop Summary

You have now completed the workshop.  I hope you enjoyed working through the various sections building up to the final solution.

Hopefully you now have a good understanding of some of the work needed to create an IoT solution.  In this workshop you:

This is just a taster of the many skills needed to implement an IoT solution.   Below you will find links to sources of continued learning, where you can explore in more depth some of the topics you touched in this workshop:

## Coursera courses provided by IBM

IBM has created a number of courses on the Coursera learning platform.  These courses can be taken for free (the audit course option) or can be purchased.  When auditing a course you get access to the learning material, but cannot take the marked assessments and do not earn the course certificate or IBM Open Badge.  If you choose to purchase the course then you need to complete all the marked assessments and once passes, you will earn a Coursera course certificate and optionally an IBM Open Badge, showing you have completed the course.  

There is also a Data Science specialization, which comprises of 3 courses and a capstone project:

- Data Science - [Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm)
  - [Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ds)
  - [Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-machine-learning-signal-processing)
  - [Applied AI with DeepLearning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai)
